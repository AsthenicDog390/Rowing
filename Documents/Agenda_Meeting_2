##QUESTIONS:

##PROGRESS:
* Finished draft of Assignment 1

* Added template to project structure

##NOTES:
* Change name of draft assignment - ROW instead of Rowing
* Not take into consideration "subscription"
* Anyone can add events
* Person that created event will accept/reject
* Not necessary to keep the history of events 
* Logging out shouldn't be a *must have*
* *Moscow diagram* to be changed
* Notifications to be a *could have* & create a single line about it 
* Rephrase the first *should have* feature & the feature about password storage
* Storing passwords is non-functional 
* Specify test coverage
* Specify we are using Scrum methodology & we are using microservices and API
* Typos
* Argument why we have chosen this microservice
* Not leave *Positions* as bounded context - not a microservice
